This is a short description on how to make a new CosmosEx release
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The releases for all the distros are here:
https://github.com/atarijookie/ce-atari-releases.git

The current branches (distros) are:
- jessie
- stretch

Do a clone of that distro:
git clone https://github.com/atarijookie/ce-atari-releases.git

...and switch to the branch (distro) you are changing:
git checkout your_distro

You will do a release for the general public by git commit and git push to the desired branch. 
If you don't have permission for that, create a pull request and someone who has the permission might merge it.

Files specific for single distro are only in the branch for that distro.
Files which are shared by multiple distros can / have to be copies to all the branches.

Branch master is currently unused.

When you are releasing new firmware file for chips, you might need to update (or create) .version file:
franz.version
hans.version
xilinx.version
xlnx2a.version
xlnx2s.version

There files contain date of the firmware release for each individual file, without dashes, like this:
20161130
- this means year 2016, month 11, day 30.
(The version with dashes like this 2016-11-30 was used before, but it's hard to compare in shell.)
