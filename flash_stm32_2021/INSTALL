Building stm32flash

A set of static makefiles is provided that should work on most operating
systems with a standard build environment, for instance GNU make and gcc.

1. Build executable

	make

2. Install executable and manual page (optional)

	make install

   The install location base can be set with the PREFIX flag (default
   is /usr/local), e.g. make install PREFIX=/opt


Using autotools

If using a git checkout, you must have autoconf installed and run:

	autoreconf -i -v

to generate configure and various macro files. If using the release
tarballs this step is not necessary.

Then run ./configure to generate makefiles. Use ./configure --help to
list general options.

Finally run "make" and "make install" as described above.
